 * A binary tree is a non-linear DS where each node can have atmost two children.

 *    Leaf node - have 0 children.
 *    Now to search any node you will have to search entire tree in worst case scenario (Time complexity = O(n))
 *    As there is no ordering.
 *    Insertion of node is done in level order.
